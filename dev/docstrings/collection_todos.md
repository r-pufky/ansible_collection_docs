move r_pufky.deb.tests to r_pufky.tests and deploy as NO DEP/PLATFORM AGNOSTIC independent role
r_pufky -> r-pufky (actual galaxy username)

Get collection role working on galaxy
- r_pufky.deb.apt works
- r-pufky.deb.apt does not
- r-pufky.apt does not
-- collection was init'd with "ansible-galaxy collection init --init-path . r_pufky.srv"

unsure why


USE r_pufky FOR THE NEW COLLECTION NAMESPACE, NOT r-pufky!!!

*ALL* roles must be in a collection to be certified ansible content.

Use libraries for common operations.

Migrate to using standardized libraries for common operations and tests
within the role.

Changed:
* Migrate OS roles to r_pufky.deb collection.
* Migrate common test patterns to r_pufky.lib.tests.
* Minimize use of line-length yamllint disable.
* Standardize molecule test docstrings.
