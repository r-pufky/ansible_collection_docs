## Add collection ignore files
Add files that should not be included in the built collection; such as tests.

`0640 {USER}:{USER}` {COLLECTION}/galaxy.yml
``` yaml
build_ignore:
  - .gitignore
  - changelogs/.plugin-cache.yaml
```
[Reference](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_collections_distributing.html#ignoring-files-and-folders)

## Update collection submodule reference
Required otherwise the collection will not use the updated module on checkout.

[Update Submodule Reference](creation.md#update-submodules-for-collection)

## Versioning
Per [Semantic Versioning v2](https://semver.org/)

* Bump version in [galaxy.yml](../../galaxy.yml)
  * Major: new platform release (debian release) / breaking changes
  * Minor: added functionality / non-breaking changes
  * Point: bug fixes / updates
* Tag commit with galaxy version per [galaxy.yml](../../galaxy.yml)

Until collection is migrated publicly Major will always be `0` as this
prevent galaxy inclusion (`1.0.0` is the minimum version).

Versioning follows Debian release (12 - 12 Bookworm). On a new debian release:
* Create a hard branch for release (with codename).
* Main becomes the new Debian release.
* Mark branch release as no longer supported (after migration is completed).

### Track Project Updates
* Always link to the latest release (or release page).
* Set alerts to check for new release (or push notifications) for each role.

## Build Galaxy Release

``` bash
ansible-galaxy collection build
ansible-galaxy collection publish
```
